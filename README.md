# 1. INTRODUCTION
We are conducting our project on building a music recommendation product with key focus on new song discovery and explainability. The system is an attempt to generate a playlist by suggesting songs heard by users having similar preferences. The product will take Spotify user-id of the user as an input and will generate a music recommendation playlist. The UI will also have toggles to select a mood to update the recommended playlist and will also have an explanation window for why a song was recommended. We plan to use a hybrid approach - a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering- to develop our recommendation system. The user data will be procured from Spotify for Developers‚Äô Web API and the user-song data is taken from subset of LastFM [6] dataset. The Spotify API provides access to multi-level data such as user‚Äôs playlist data, song‚Äôs attribute data, artist data etc and the LastFM data has user and song interaction data.

# 2. PROBLEM DEFINITION
There are state of the art song recommendation systems available such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon
Music etc. but they lack in 2 key areas: 1) They fail to
provide any explainability on why a particular song
was recommended. 2) These recommendation system
do not provide users with tools to control the recom-
mendations . Through our product, we aim to address
these challenges.

# 3. LITERATURE REVIEW
Several research papers have been published over the
years on recommendation systems, and visualization
in the context of song recommendation. A few of them
are discussed below.

## 3.1 Single User Recommendation
Recommendation systems are widely used applications
of machine learning. They provide suggestions for items
that may be useful to the customer and help users avoid
selection paralysis. As suggested in [13] and [ 2 ], rec-
ommendation systems majorly use two approaches: i)
Collaborative filtering i.e. assumption that people with
similar preferences in past are likely to prefer same
items in the future, and ii) content-based filtering i.e.
recommendation based on the item‚Äôs features.
Although novel techniques for recommendation have
been used in the domain of Deep Learning [ 9 ], [ 7 ], they
lack in explainability and in performance with respect
to sparse matrices. Recommendations can be made ex-
plainable by using a variant of matrix factorization al-
gorithm (AMCF -> Attentive Multitask Collaborative
filtering)[ 1] that accounts for explainable recommenda-
tions [ 4]. The model will learn to map the difficult-to-
interpret latent features onto the space of interpretable
input features space using an attention mechanism as
used in [ 15]. Sparse autoencoders [ 3 ] can also be used
with a similar setup to provide better personalized rec-
ommendations. We plan to perform user studies for
evaluation as conducted in [16].

## 3.2 Group Recommendation*
A key aspect is to identify how to make a recommendation for the group. [ 13] suggests two methodologies:
i) developing recommendations for individuals and aggregating it for a group, and ii) aggregating individual preferences into a group and using this group to make recommendations. Combining individual ratings of users we can aggregate them using different metrics such as Plurality Voting, Average, Least Misery, Most Pleasure and feed into the single user recommendation model. Designing explanations for group recommendations is another challenge[5 ] This paper, in the case of Col-
laborative Filtering talks about providing explanations
based on based on the ratings of the nearest neigh-
bors. Simplistic strategies have also been suggested for
content-based recommendation systems.
Few considerations while designing group recom-
mendation systems is handling fairness, this paper[ 5]
talks about how including at least x items for each user
can be one such way. Building Consensus is another
nuance. It can be measured by checking the amount of
disagreement between ratings of users.

3.3 Visualization
We surveyed papers to identify effective method of user
engagement through interaction. [ 8] inspected the re-
lationship between musicology and visualization. It‚Äôs
extensive task based analysis on previous existing visu-
alizations provided insight towards our proposed visual
interface. [ 14] discussed multiple algorithms to visu-
alize network graphs such as forced directed network
graph, network matrix etc.
Second, we look at the [10 ], which attempted to tackle
the problem of music exploration. A subsequent work
[ 11 ] implemented a comparative study on the visualiza-
tion experience of the previous paper and their own; the
visualizations with user control helped justify recom-
mendations. Therefore, we plan to incorporate mood
control similar to [11] Additionally, giving the users
control over recommendations can be incorporated by
providing mood based toggles[12].
4 METHODOLOGY
The design of the product is discussed in below sections:
4.1 Data Preparation
We are using MLHD data set for building our recommen-
dation system. The dataset has user-song interaction
information of 992 users for 1083471 songs. Although
the data set has records from 2006-2013, it is sparsely
populated from 2009-2013 and thus we will only use
2006-2008 data for training our model. This data con-
tains time based user-song interaction information. We
will utilize this information to create a user-song inter-
action rating matrix. Rating is a score in range 1-5 that
suggests how much a user likes the song. We developed
this rating by calculating monthly song frequency and
inverse song frequency. Monthly song frequency(TF)
is defined as the number of times a user has listened
to a song in a month and inverse song frequency(IDF)
is defined as a function of the number of users who
have listened to that song in that particular month. So
overall, the rating for that month is given as:
Rating = TFMt ‚àó IDFMt
where,
IDFMt = log( N
1 + df )
N : Total Number of users
df : Number of users who have listened to that song in
that particular month
This is done so that we capture niche user tastes in our
song recommendation and songs that are listened by rel-
atively less users is given higher weightage. Further, to
capture temporal relationship, we give relatively higher
weightage to recent songs i.e. most recent month is
given weight as 1, second recent month is given weight
as (23/24) and so on.
Further, we extracted following data-sets from Spo-
tify‚Äôs Web API: 1) New user‚Äôs song data, 2) MLHD
Song‚Äôs attributes, and 3) Top 500 songs of 2022 and
Top 500 songs of All time playlist‚Äôs songs and their
attributes.
4.2 Recommendation Algorithms
We will be using the following set of algorithms for
forking out recommendations to the end users :
Collaborative Filtering
In this technique, we can base our algorithm either
on user-user or on song-song similarity. We identify
a set of closest neighbors for a given user i (identi-
fied through the Pearson correlation coefficient) based
on their ratings for common songs. Then, we take the
weighted average of the ratings that these neighbor-
ing users give to a song j in order to come up with a
predicted rating r(i,j) for a given user i for the song j.
Also , to account for user bias, we compute the same on
deviations of ratings around the mean for a given user.
Matrix Factorization Algorithm
This algorithm uses the concept of singular value de-
composition technique to express users and songs in
terms of latent factors (k-dimensional latent feature
space). We can then use cosine distance to identify the
songs with the highest similarity to a given user‚Äôs liking.
Explainable Matrix Factorization Algorithm
This algorithm is a variant of the above-mentioned ma-
trix factorization algorithm wherein we also provide as
input , external metadata in the form of interpretable
song features which could be used to help explain rec-
ommendations. For each item latent factor j, we train a
2

predictor
ùëìùëó ‚âà ùëñùëñ ùëó
in terms of the known interpretable attributes for a song
i. Thus, we would get a mapping from the interpretable
feature to latent feature set .
This mapping would help us understand which of the
interpretable features are driving the individual latent
factors.
Now, given that a song (s) was recommended to a
user (u) , it means that the feature vectors of the song
and user in latent space were similar. Using this, we
can identify the latent dimension in which the feature
vectors had the highest similarity. Given this latent
dimension, we can use the above-computed mapper to
get the corresponding interpretable song feature.
Thus, we would be able to back our recommenda-
tions in terms of simple interpretable song features.
Out of the above algorithms, we went through with
Collaborative Filtering. Our tests with matrix factoriza-
tion were not promising due to the size of our dataset.
We were unable to improve on the large computation
time needed.
4.3 Data Workflow
The process involved taking the spotify user id as input
and getting data output for developing tableau dash-
board. It can be divided into the following steps: 1) Tak-
ing user Spotify user-id and pulling all their playlists
and extracting all songs 2) Mapping user genre affinity.
3) Identify genre representative songs. 4) Creating user
song matrix for a new user that is used as an input for
collaborative filtering algorithm. 5) Generating person-
alised playlist using recommendation engine. 6) Gener-
ating recommendations from "Top 500 songs of 2022"
and "Top 500 songs of All Time" playlists by mapping
ranked output to the mentioned playlist using cosine
similarity. As user has intrinsic preferences towards a
type of song, we exploited this assumption to map rec-
ommended songs to out of corpus songs using content
based similarity. The data pipeline produces 3 output
files that are used as an input for Tableau dashboard.

4.4 Visualization and Product
Features
The final product is a Tableau dashboard that uses
Data workflow output. It shows the personalised recom-
mended playlist and graphical representation of music
attributes. Further, it provide tools to control the rec-
ommendations and dynamically update the playlist as
per user‚Äôs mood.
Figure 2: Product User Interface
The user interface has the following sections: 1) Input
field to take user‚Äôs spotify id. 2) Playlist panel that has
recommended songs along with their respective ranks
3) Graphical representation of recommended playlist‚Äôs
song attributes. 4) Mood Control bar to control and
change the recommendations as per user‚Äôs mood. 5)
"How recommendation works?" button to describe and
visualise how recommendations work.
The mood control section has the following toggles:
1) Choose Your Music: Selecting recommendation type

from 3 options- Feeling Nostalgic, Best of 2022, and
Best of All Times. 2)Danceability 3) Energy 4) Instru-
mentalness 5) Liveness 6) Song in Minutes: Length of a
song in minutes.
Figure 4: User Neighbour Interaction View
The "How recommendation works?" button showcases
the explainability aspect of the product. It visually ex-
plains the concept of collaborative filtering and visual-
izes user-neighbour interactions.
4.5 Innovations
Summarizing the above sections, we introduced follow-
ing innovation through our product : 1) Defining rating
matrix using song listening history of users. 2) Explain-
ability aspect to recommendation i.e. explaining the
attributes of the recommended playlist. 3) Interactive
Mood controls giving users control over their recom-
mendations. 4) Toggle to recommend songs from "Top
500 songs of 2022" and "Top 500 songs of All Time"
playlists i.e. out of corpus recommendations. 5) Func-
tionality to recommend songs to new users i.e. Spotify
users not part of MLHD dataset 5) Visualizing working
of recommendation algorithm using user-neighbour
interactions.
5 EVALUATION
We conduct following evaluation process for our rec-
ommendation system.
Train-Test Validation: In this step, we evaluate the
recommendation system algorithm using train-test val-
idation. We use the train data to develop our model
using the above mentioned methodology and use it to
predict the user rating for songs in test data. We use
RMSE (root mean square error) metric to evaluate the
performance.
RMSE =
‚àöÔ∏Ç 1
ùëõ
‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëÅ
ùëõ=1 (ùúñùëñ ‚àí ÀÜùúñ)2
User Validation: We conducted a user study where we
asked a few users to share their spotify user-id and our
product generated a playlist recommendation. We then asked the user to rate the recommendation as good or
bad. We defined the performance on the basis of the
accuracy of recommendations.
Accuracy = Total Good Recommendations ‚àó 100
Total Recommendation
The results were as follows:
Ranking Based Evaluations
Although we can evaluate our recommendation sys-
tems through the above 2 methods, it is important
thing when making out recommendations is the or-
der in which recommendations are made . Thus, we
will use the 2 below mentioned metrics for evaluating
the output of our recommendation system .
Ranking Evaluation Metrics:
1. Mean Average Precision@K:
This metric measures how many of the recommended
results are relevant and are showing at the top. Preci-
sion@K is the fraction of relevant items in the top K
recommended results. The mean average precision@K
measures the average precision@K averaged over all
queries in the dataset.
ùê¥ùëÉ@ùëò = 1
ùëüùëò
ùëò‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëò=1
ùë†ùëò ‚àó ùëüùëíùëô (ùëò)/ùëò

where ùë†ùëò is the number of relevant songs in top k results,
rel(k) = 1 if kth songs are relevant and 0 otherwise
ùíéùë®ùë∑ @ùíå = 1
ùëµ
ùëµ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùíä=1
ùë®ùë∑ @ùíå
2. Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain:
Gain refers to the relevance score for each item (song
in this case) recommended. Cumulative gain at K is the
sum of gains of the first K items recommended. Dis-
counted cumulative gain (DCG) weighs each relevance
score based on its position, with a higher weight to the
recommendations at the top.
ùëÅ ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫@ùêæ = ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫@ùêæ
ùêº ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫@ùêæ
, where
ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫@ùêæ =
ùêæ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=1
ùê∫ùëñ
ùëôùëúùëî2 (ùëñ + 1) and
ùêº ùê∑ùê∂ùê∫@ùêæ =
ùêæùëñ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=1
ùê∫ùëñ
ùëôùëúùëî2 (ùëñ + 1) , where ùêæùëñ is K(ideal) and
ùê∫ùëñ is G (relevance score of each recommended item).
Results:
We followed two different approaches to sample our
dataset into 80%-20% train-test split. The first approach
takes a stratified sampling route where for each user the
split is done randomly into 80-20 split. The second ap-
proach does an overall random shuffling and we obtain
the train (80%) and test (20%).
Figure 5: RMSE-MSE Evaluation
Figure 6: Ranking Evaluation
The ranking metrics (MAPK for k = 3 : 0.773, Mean
NDCG: 0.873) and the RMSE values show that our col-
laborative filtering algorithm does a good job in the
prediction of ratings as well as generating relevant song
recommendations.

6 EXPERIMENTS
We conducted user survey to seek feedback on our
product. We got 17 responses and the overall response
5 was positive. One promising observation has been a
strong positive response for "Explainability Visualiza-
tion" from respondents who did not care about explain-
ability in the first place.

8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
SCOPE
Through our final product, the team was able to address
all the key challenges mentioned in the "Problem Def-
inition" section. Following milestones were achieved:
1) Product to generate personalised playlists. 2) Incor-
porate explainability aspect to recommendations. 3)
Adding tools for users to control and dynamically up-
date recommendations.
However, there are shortcomings which we would like
to work in future. 1) The product might face challenges
with scalability due to a) dependency on Spotify API to
fetch songs and b) recommendation algorithm latency
2) Recommendation is based on old data and on the
assumption that music tastes are purely based on song
characteristics.
Although we are answering a few existing challenges
in state-of-the-art recommendation systems, there is
potential to improve on the following aspects in future:
1) Making recommendations for a group. 2) Incorpo-
rating user feedback for recommended songs in UI(
Like/Dislike button) and using their responses to im-
prove the recommendation.

APPENDIX
There was an update in the team structure in middle of
the semester. One of our team members dropped out of
the course on 28th Oct‚Äô2022. This change forced us to
redefine the scope of the project and hence you might
see deviation from initial proposal.
The scope was redefined in the following areas. 1)
Considering the drop of a team member and difficulty in
evaluation of group recommendation(especially given
the change in data set) we limited our scope to single
user recommendation. 2) Getting access to users listen-
ing history was a challenge as the API does not expose
this without explicit user authorization. We only get
access to public playlists of the user. Thus we used the
Last.fm Data set to base our recommendations. This
opened the challenge of recommending songs to a new
user which we have addressed in the Data Workflow
section.
